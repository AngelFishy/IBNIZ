Some days ago, I finished the first public version of my audiovisual virtual
machine, IBNIZ. I also showed it off on YouTube with the following video:
</p>

<p> As demonstrated by the video, IBNIZ is a virtual machine and a
programming language that generates video and audio from very short strings
of code. Technically, it is a two-stack machine somewhat similar to Forth,
but with the major execption that the stack is cyclical and also used at an
output buffer. Also, as every IBNIZ program is implicitly inside a loop that
pushes a set of loop variables on the stack on every cycle, even an empty
program outputs something (i.e. a changing gradient as video and a constant
sawtooth wave as audio). </p>

<p>To illustrate how IBNIZ works, here's a step-to-step analysis of how the
program <b>^xp</b> executes:</p>

<p>Every IBNIZ program is implicitly within a loop that pushes a set of loop
variables on the stack.
